It scales from single servers to thousands of machines, each providing local computation and storage. A key component is the Hadoop File System (HDFS), designed for large-scale distributed data processing. It allows storage of large data sets (e.g., 100 TB) as a single file, replicates data for availability, and distributes it over multiple machines for parallel processing. HDFS applications require a write-once-read-many access model for files, simplifying data coherency issues and enabling high throughput data access."
